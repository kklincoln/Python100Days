## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything

five_pct_diff = (close_price_diff / yesterday_closing_price) * 100

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator
if five_pct_diff > close_price_diff:
    #TODO: ADJUST THIS BACK TO < after testing

    response = requests.get(url="https://newsapi.org/v2/everything",params=news_params)
    response.raise_for_status()
    data =response.json
    print(data)



## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.



#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
