<h1>The Best Movies According to Kiernan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
  Nearly every movie produced by Christopher Noal is sure to be a great watch,
  eliciting a level of intellectual investment from the viewer, coupled with a
  suprising amount of visual artistry, all while avoiding CGI wherever possible.
  This story depicts a man grappling with the desires of his past, which were
  ripped away from him without potential for execution, until a new opportunity
  presents itself in the form of an unexpected visitor. Though the journey
  extends through decades and thousands of miles, the underlying message becomes
  apparent as one discerns whether the promise was fulfilled.

<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p>
  If you knew the outcome of a situation, even if potentially traumatic, would
  you still walk the path? Unexpected visitors carry a message to Earth,
  triggering a race against nations across the globe to be the first to discover
  the meaning. Are these visitors friend or foe? Emotional connections tie the
  visitors to the researchers tasked with deciphering the messages, but the
  power of the messages conveyed may be more than anticipated, potentially even
  paradoxical.
</p>
<br />
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>
  As we venture closer toward a potential for intelligent design, the question
  about whether technology will reach the point of superceding human
  interlligence and potentially replacing itself above us in the social
  heirarchy, a programmer's world is ripped from underneath him after making a
  choice to know the truth. In order for the truth to be able to stand on its
  own, one must first remove knowledge of anything which contradicts, in the
  search for the one true meaning.
